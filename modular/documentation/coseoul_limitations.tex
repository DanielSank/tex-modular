\levelstay{\fixedwidth{coseoul} limitations}

All listings here are taken directly from files included with this package so that you can access those files and build them yourself to see the examples in action.
All paths are relative to \fixedwidth{documentation/example}.

Suppose we write an octopus article with two sections:\footnote{build \fixedwidth{octopus/article.tex} to see the article yourself.}

\lstinputlisting[title=\textbf{octopus/article.tex}]{example/octopus/article.tex}

\lstinputlisting[title=\textbf{octopus/content.tex}]{example/octopus/content.tex}

\lstinputlisting[title=\textbf{octopus/habitat.tex}]{example/octopus/habitat.tex}

\lstinputlisting[title=\textbf{octopus/lifecycle.tex}]{example/octopus/lifecycle.tex}
This works great.
Now let's try to use the octopus article as a sub-part of an article on sea animals:

\lstinputlisting[title=\textbf{article\_fail.tex}]{example/article_fail.tex}
As you can see by building \fixedwidth{article\_fail.tex} yourself, the habitat and lifecycle parts come in as sections instead of subsections.
